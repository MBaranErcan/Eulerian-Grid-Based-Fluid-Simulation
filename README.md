# Eulerian Grid-Based Fluid Simulation

This project implements a 2D Eulerian grid-based fluid simulation using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques.

The simulation includes key components such as diffusion, advection, and projection to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flow.

Features

•	Linear Solver: Utilizes Gauss-Seidel relaxation for solving linear systems.

•	Boundary Conditions: Handles boundary conditions for velocity and scalar fields.

•	Diffusion: Simulates the spreading of substances within the fluid.

•	Advection: Transports quantities like velocity and density through the fluid.

•	Projection: Ensures the velocity field is divergence-free, maintaining incompressibility.
